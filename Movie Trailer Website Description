# Project 2 - Movie Trailer Website
The basic motivation behind the project was to get a foundations in Programming.

## Dependencies
The project requires API key from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), to generate the movie trailer page.

## Usage
Run entertainment_center.py and input the movie titles you want to list on your movie trailer website along with the API Key. Rest is automated by the code.
Rest of the code is documented for further usage. 

## Sample Website

Have a look at the site [here] (fresh_tomatoes.html)

I have also added the sample html page generated.
